# DS_IBM_Final_Project

This project focuses on comprehensive data collection related to SpaceX rocket launches by employing a dual methodology. The data acquisition process combines API requests from SpaceX's public API and web scraping from specific tables within SpaceX's Wikipedia entry. The gathered data is organized into distinct columns, providing detailed insights into each launch.

Data Sources:

SpaceX API: Extracts information such as Flight Number, Date, Booster Version, Payload Mass, Orbit, Launch Site, Outcome, Flights, Grid Fins, Reused, Legs, Landing, Block, Reused Count, Serial, Longitude, and Latitude.

Wikipedia Web Scraping: Retrieves data columns including Flight No., Launch site, Payload, Payload Mass, Orbit, Customer, Launch outcome, Version Booster, Booster landing, Date, and Time.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage by analyzing relevant data. The collected information is crucial for assessing launch costs and aiding potential competitors in deciding whether to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.
