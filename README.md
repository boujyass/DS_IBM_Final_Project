# SpaceX Rocket Launch Data Project

## Overview

This project focuses on comprehensive data collection related to SpaceX rocket launches by employing a dual methodology. The data acquisition process combines API requests from SpaceX's public API and web scraping from specific tables within SpaceX's Wikipedia entry. The gathered data is organized into distinct columns, providing detailed insights into each launch.

## Data Sources

### SpaceX API

Extracts information such as:
- Flight Number
- Date
- Booster Version
- Payload Mass
- Orbit
- Launch Site
- Outcome
- Flights
- Grid Fins
- Reused
- Legs
- Landing
- Block
- Reused Count
- Serial
- Longitude
- Latitude

### Wikipedia Web Scraping

Retrieves data columns including:
- Flight No.
- Launch site
- Payload
- Payload Mass
- Orbit
- Customer
- Launch outcome
- Version Booster
- Booster landing
- Date
- Time

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to predict the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage by analyzing relevant data. The collected information is crucial for assessing launch costs and aiding potential competitors in deciding whether to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Usage

The data collected can be utilized for various analyses, including cost prediction, launch outcome assessment, and decision-making processes for companies considering participation in the competitive space launch industry.
